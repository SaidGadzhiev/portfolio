## Web Design

In the realm of web design, I approach each project as an opportunity to create immersive and user-friendly experiences. Here's an insight into my web design philosophy:

- **User-Centered Approach:** I prioritize user experience by designing intuitive interfaces that guide users seamlessly through the content.

- **Visual Aesthetics:** I believe in the power of aesthetics. I use a harmonious blend of colors, typography, and imagery to create visually engaging websites.

- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring that websites look and function well across devices is crucial. I design responsive layouts that adapt to various screen sizes.

- **Wireframing and Prototyping:** Before diving into development, I create wireframes and interactive prototypes to visualize the user journey and gather feedback.

## Web Development

The world of web development empowers me to turn creative designs into functional, dynamic websites. Here's how I approach the development process:

- **Tech Stack Mastery:** My proficiency in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript allows me to craft interactive and engaging web applications.

- **Frameworks and Libraries:** I leverage technologies like React to build seamless single-page applications with reusable components.

- **Version Control and Deployment:** I employ Git for version control and deploy projects using platforms like GitHub Pages or Heroku.

<!-- # My portfolio built with React Create

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is made by Said Gadzhiev

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
